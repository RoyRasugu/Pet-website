                nature.
                It is no wonder most people<br> adopt them as pets. We all agree dog is the "so called"
                <br>man's friends but that is all in the past. Now with all<br>changing times, people are
                getting used to cats, taking <br>them to vaca, posting them on social media and all <br>
                whatsoever. Cats in general are clean since they understand<br> the importance of hygiene
                and are very agile which really<br> captivates me alot.
